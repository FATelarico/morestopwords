# Introduction

`stopwords` is an R package originally developed by [Kohei Watanabe](https://github.com/koheiw) of the Waseda Institute for Advanced Study (check out his publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9BGfT7EAAAAJ&hl=en)) that provides easy access to stopwords in more than 50 languages in the Stopwords ISO library.

The package has not been updated since Dec 22, 2017 and was not installable anymore from `GitHub`. So, this reboot happened to grant continuity to the project.

# Installation

### CRAN (Stable release)

```
install.packages('stopwords')
```

### GitHub (Development version)

```
if(requireNamespace('remotes'))
remotes::install_github('fatelarico/stopwords')
```
# Usage

The code base has changed since version 0.1.0 (the last maintained by Dr. Watanabe). Now, the function `stopwords::stopwords()` supports not only two-letter ISO codes, but also three-letter ones. Moreover, it can identify languages by their ISO name (e.g., German, not *Deutsch*; Swedish, not *Sverige*, etc.).

Also, the package does not depend on `rjson` anymore.
